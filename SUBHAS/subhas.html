  Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure.
  <br><br>
  Subhas Chandra Bose (also called Netaji) is known for his role in India's independence movement. A participant of the noncooperation movement and a leader of the Indian National Congress, he was part of the more militant wing and known for his advocacy of socialist. 
  <br><br>
  Bose authored the book 'The Indian Struggle' which covers the Indian independence movement from 1920 to 1942. The book was banned by the British government. He coined the term 'Jai Hind'. His charisma and powerful personality inspired many people into the freedom struggle and continues to inspire Indians.
